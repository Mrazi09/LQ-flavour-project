# Leptoquark-project---Data
Data for the Leptoquark research project, which corresponds to the paper: "On interplay between flavour anomalies and neutrino properties" by myself and collaborators. arXiv:2206.01674 

---> Data: Data from first version

---> Data_v2: Data from second version. Corresponds to the data of the submitted version

---> Best_v2: Best fit points from the second version. Corresponds to the data of the submitted version 

---> Auxliar condes: Contains two notebooks to clarify some questions. Namely, in Neutrino_inversion.ipynb we demonstrate how to invert the equations and determine the Yukawa parameters, respecting the mass differences and the PMNS mixing matrix. In Read_neutrino.ipynb, we show an example on reading the provided data and determing the PMNS and neutrino mass differences.
